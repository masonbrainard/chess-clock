# chess-clock
This project was made to create a chess clock for over the board play.
At time of writing, I have completed the first working version: CC_V1.

A few design requirements I had for CC_V1 included:
1. Two Buttons for players to press on their respective turn
2. Two 7 segment displays to show time
3. Two Buttons to change settings of the clock with.
4. A buzzer to indicate that time has expired.

With these in mind, I used a Atmega 328 microcontroller as I have expierence with it in the past.
I also use a 9V battery to power with a L780V IC to bring it to 5V.
Please check out a few pictures I have uploaded in the folder "CC_V1" to see the final product.

With CC_V1 complete, I am working on CC_V2 with several improvements over the first version.
